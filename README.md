# ü§ñ AI Voice Agent

A voice-driven AI assistant that can handle phone calls, transcribe speech, generate AI-powered replies, and respond back via text-to-speech.

---

## üîπ Overview

The AI Voice Agent captures incoming phone calls using **Twilio**, converts speech to text via **Google Speech-to-Text**, generates conversational replies using **Gemini API**, and converts the replies back to speech to play to the caller.  

This project demonstrates a scalable voice interaction system that integrates multiple APIs and real-time processing for seamless AI-driven conversations.

## üéØ How It Works

1. Caller dials the Twilio number.
2. Twilio sends call audio to the backend via webhook.
3. Audio is transcribed into text.
4. Transcribed text is sent to Gemini API to generate a response.
5. Response text is converted to speech and played back to the caller.
