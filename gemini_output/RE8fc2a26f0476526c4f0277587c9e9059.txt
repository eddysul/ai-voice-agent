Okay! To help me find the best two Indian restaurants for you, I need a little more information.

*   **What area of New York are you interested in?** (e.g., Manhattan, Brooklyn)
*   **What's your budget?** (e.g., cheap eats, mid-range, expensive)
*   **Are there any specific cuisines you're looking for?** (e.g., South Indian, North Indian, specific dishes)
